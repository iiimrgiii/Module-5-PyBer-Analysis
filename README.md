## Summary
Recommendations to the CEO

1- I would shoot to increase the amount of drives in the Suburbs and rural areas to help minimize the amount of loss business. or Incentive trips for drivers in other areas to go to those areas in peak times. 

2- Incentives more drivers around holidays. You will have much less loss of business, and there before be more profitable. 

3- Advertise holiday promotions for customers around holidays. Such as free rides on holidays for new customers. You will lose on the first ride, but it will be win later on with normal fares and rides when they need it and they already have our product setup so its much easier and faster to get those rides and fares.
